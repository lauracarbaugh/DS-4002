# Hot Dog Survey Data

We collected data from undergraduate students using an online survey. The raw responses are stored in the file "Hotdog Survey (Responses).csv", and the data dictionary describing all variables is provided in the file "Hot Dog Data Dictionary - Sheet1.csv". We hope to then conduct an exploratory data analysis and explore potential bias in order to form conclusions about the data.
